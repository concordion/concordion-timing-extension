This [Concordion](http://www.concordion.org) extension provides the capability to embed the processing time
of each specification example at runtime.

The [demo project](https://github.com/concordion/concordion-timing-extension-demo) demonstrates this extension.

# Introduction

Often it is useful to know how long a given example takes to run. This extension provides this by printing the
timing to screen for each example.
